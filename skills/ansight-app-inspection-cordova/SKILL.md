description: Add Capacitor DOM and native-platform semantics to an Ansight operation. Use alongside a selected core Ansight workflow when WebView DOM, JavaScript errors, native hierarchy, bridge state, or DOM tool behavior affects interpretation; do not use as the primary live-operation, remote-tool, session-investigation, or annotation workflow.
compatibility: Ansight CLI 0.40.x; compare with ansight version --json

## Claude Code plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands with Claude Code’s Bash tool on the machine that owns the resident host. If this session cannot execute commands or reach that host, explain the missing prerequisite and do not claim a live inspection succeeded. The plugin’s session-start note reports the CLI, host, and connected-session state it found; re-check with the commands below before acting on it. This skill’s `compatibility` line names the CLI minor version its commands describe: compare it with `ansight version --json`; if the installed CLI is older, report the gap and offer `ansight update apply` with the user’s approval; if it is newer, say the plugin is behind, suggest `claude plugin update ansight`, and treat `ansight <command> help` as the authority wherever it disagrees with this skill. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight Cordova / Capacitor Inspection Semantics

Use this companion skill for supported Cordova-family apps built with Capacitor. Do not infer support for a classic Apache Cordova app or a web-only project without the Ansight Capacitor bridge.

## Keep The Core Workflow In Charge

Select the skill that owns the requested outcome before applying these Capacitor semantics:

- live lifecycle or visible UI interaction: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-operate-live-app/SKILL.md`
- bundled or app-specific remote tools: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-use-remote-app-tools/SKILL.md`
- live or recorded evidence investigation: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-investigate-session/SKILL.md`
- annotation writes: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-annotate-session/SKILL.md`

The selected core skill owns session selection, authorization, command procedure, verification, reporting, and any relevant workspace reuse. Use this skill only to interpret Capacitor-specific evidence or choose among cataloged DOM and native tool families.

## Interpret DOM And Native Evidence

- Use cataloged `dom.get_document`, `dom.inspect_node`, or `dom.query_selector` when DOM ownership, WebView structure, attributes, styles, or bridge-rendered content are material.
- Use cataloged native `ui.*` tools for UIKit or Android hierarchy, screenshots, native overlays, platform views, and rendering or hit-testing outside the DOM.
- Treat DOM nodes, native nodes, automation IDs, and reflection roots as separate namespaces unless a returned schema explicitly connects them.
- Compare DOM and native evidence when diagnosing a mismatch between WebView state and rendered platform UI.
- `dom.invoke_action` and similar DOM actions are remote writes. Keep semantic device interaction as the default for a visible user flow and follow the core remote-tool skill for authorized internal operations.

## JavaScript, Bridge, And Fallback Semantics

A paired build may stream captured JavaScript errors, app-provided logs, Ansight diagnostics, telemetry, screenshots, touches, and tool results. Use browser devtools only when WebView console, network, or runtime evidence unavailable through Ansight is required; use Xcode or Android system logs for complete native process output.

Use browser devtools, Xcode, ADB, simulator or emulator tools, app-container access, or source inspection only after the owning core skill identifies a concrete Ansight capability gap. Report whether the gap was in the DOM adapter, native hierarchy, bridge, cataloged tools, retained evidence, or device control.

## Report Capacitor-Specific Evidence

In addition to the core skill's report, name the native target, distinguish DOM evidence from native hierarchy evidence, and identify any JavaScript, bridge, native, or fallback surface used.
