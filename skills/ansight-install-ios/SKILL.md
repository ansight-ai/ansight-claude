description: Install the native iOS Ansight SDK with automatic Simulator registration and one-shot CLI QR enrollment for physical devices. Add the aggregate SwiftPM product or pod, initialize from app startup, expose the SDK scanner from a developer-only surface, add only Apple-required privacy descriptions, verify the build, and inspect the app through the Ansight CLI.
compatibility: Ansight CLI 0.40.x; compare with ansight version --json

## Claude Code plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands with Claude Code’s Bash tool on the machine that owns the resident host. If this session cannot execute commands or reach that host, explain the missing prerequisite and do not claim a live inspection succeeded. The plugin’s session-start note reports the CLI, host, and connected-session state it found; re-check with the commands below before acting on it. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight iOS Install Skill

Use this skill for native SwiftUI or UIKit apps.

## Outcome

The finished app must:

- link the aggregate `Ansight` product for local development;
- initialize `AnsightRuntime.shared` once from app startup;
- register automatically in Simulator or Mac Catalyst and expose the SDK QR
  scanner from a developer-only UI for physical devices;
- reconnect automatically after the first successful scan;
- add only the privacy descriptions required by the chosen flow; and
- require no generated JSON, build setting secret, certificate, or manual app
  registration.

## Workflow

1. Identify the app target, bundle id, startup delegate, dependency manager,
   debug configuration, and existing developer menu.
2. Add the aggregate SwiftPM product:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/ansight-ai/ansight-sdk.git",
    exact: "1.4.0-preview.1"
)
```

   Use `pod 'Ansight', '1.4.0-preview.1'` when the project already uses
   CocoaPods.
3. Keep both the import and initialization behind the app's Debug or explicit
   internal-build compilation condition. Initialize once:

```swift
#if DEBUG
try AnsightRuntime.shared.initializeAndActivateAnsightSdk()
#endif
```

4. Add a developer-only scanner action:

```swift
let result = await AnsightRuntime.shared.connect(
    .qrCode(title: "Scan Ansight Enrollment QR")
)
```

5. Add `NSCameraUsageDescription` because the SDK scanner uses the camera. Add
   `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` for physical devices connecting to the CLI host.
   Do not add Bluetooth, location, contacts, photos, Bonjour, or ATS clear-text
   exceptions.
6. Keep reflection, secure-storage access, writes, and deletes disabled unless
   the requested development workflow requires them.
7. Create or update `ansight-readme.md` with the scanner location, build
   verification command, and CLI enrollment commands. Do not add an enrollment
   payload or token to it.
8. Build the relevant simulator and, where practical, physical-device target.
9. Start or reuse the resident CLI host. Simulator and Mac Catalyst builds
   register automatically. For a physical device, issue one generic host QR and
   scan it from the developer-only surface:

```sh
ansight host run
ansight pairing issue --qr
ansight session list --connected --app-id <app-id> --json
ansight app tools <session-id> --detail summary --include-unavailable --max-results 50 --json
```

   Do not require `ansight app register` before the first connection. After the
   SDK supplies its real App ID, optionally link the discovered app to the
   repository with `ansight app register <app-id> --codebase <repository-path>`.

## Enrollment Behavior

Simulator and Mac Catalyst register automatically through loopback. The first
physical-device scan registers the app installation and stores a random installation
id and enrollment state privately. Later developer launches reconnect
automatically. The client uses Network.framework for its local clear-text
`ws://` development connection, so no ATS exception or certificate is needed.

## Recommended Inspection Skills

Use the main router to select the core inspection workflow. Add the native iOS
companion only when SwiftUI, UIKit, or Apple-platform semantics are material:
